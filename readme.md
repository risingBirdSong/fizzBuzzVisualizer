### fizzbuzzing

Inspired by Jeremy talking about students struggling with implementing fizz buzz; thought it would be interesting to visualize the fizzing and buzzing.

The fizzbuzz is visualized on the left and the code is represented on the right.

For a given number, the block of code that handles it is highlighted with the same color of the representation on the left hand side. This is done to help illustrate the relationship between the code block and the visual output.

## important!

I have typescript globally installed on my machine and therefore it's not a dependency. if you don't have typescript installed globally, you'll have to install it locally first. I'm not sure if this is considered good practice, if you have a suggestion i'd appreciate hearing it!

## lessons :

parcel is an awesome bundler! so nice and easy! Only had one bug which was an issue of using async await, fixed with browserlist.

CSS Grid is awesome! Great to to finally play with it.

Learned much more about useEffect, a very useful hook!

The way i've made the code representation using raw jsx was a worthwhile exercise but is time consuming and can be done better / faster by automation. Learned about libraries like Prism.js specifically to solve this problem. Plan to use libraries like those on future projects.
